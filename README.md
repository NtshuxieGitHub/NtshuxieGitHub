## 🚀 About Me  
**Passionate developer with experience in Software Engineering, Software Consulting, Business Intelligence, and Application Development.** I'm especially drawn to Web Development and Data Science, and I’m currently focused on building both data science models and full-stack web applications.

My goal is to become a full-stack developer focused on building web applications that incorporate data science solutions. I’m particularly interested in developing interactive apps where users can input data, trigger predictive models in the backend, and receive results through a clean, intuitive UI.

With a foundation in Python and MATLAB, I’m strengthening my Python skills for data science. At the same time, I’m sharpening my front-end skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and upskilling in frameworks like React and Next.js to eventually bridge the gap between web and data.
