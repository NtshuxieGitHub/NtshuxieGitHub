## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a Software Engineer with over 2 years of experience in software engineering and software consulting, specializing in application development and creation of data-driven solutions. I bring a strong foundation in both backend and frontend technologies, with a focus on building scalable, data-driven applications.

My backend experience includes working with MATLAB, MS SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB, Python (Flask), Node.js, and Express.js, with a solid track record in API development and server-side logic. On the frontend, I’ve developed responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MATLAB GUI frameworks, and the React.js library.

I'm currently enhancing my expertise in full stack MERN application development and cloud solutions, with a passion for building modern web applications that integrate seamlessly with intelligent data pipelines. I’m actively seeking opportunities as a Junior Full Stack Developer or Intermediate Software Engineer, where I can contribute to impactful projects and continue to grow as a full stack professional.
